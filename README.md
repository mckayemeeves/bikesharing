# Bike Sharing- CitiBike
## Overview and Purpose of Analysis
The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis might help answer a few key questions:

Who uses bikeshare programs?
What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
How much are the bikes used and by whom?

## Results
Des Moines, Iowa may have a different than New York City, but a brief look at the makeup of Citibike riders may show who bikeshare appeals to, no matter the person's location.

Subscribers are regular users of the Citibike share system and contribute to a predictable source of income for the program. The majority of these subscribers are male (as seen in the above image), at 5/8 to only about 1/4 female. 
1. Checkout Times for All Users- the usuage reaches a top of 3000 minutes per user.

- The bikeshare userbase covers all age demographics, from teenagers to middle age and older indivduals;
- Teenagers and early-twenty-somethings enjoy taking much longer bikerides than older users.

2. Checkout times by gender- males are significantly higher users than others

3. Trips (Weekday per Hour) Peak riding hours are 6-10am and 5-8PM during the weekday and 5am-10pm on the weekends.

A heatmap also helps show weekly usage patterns. Once again we can see the heavy bike usage during weekday commute times, and weekend usage is spread throughout the middle of the day. An interesting anomaly is the relatively low bike usage during Wednesday's end-of-day commute. It could be useful to explore reasons for this (system outage, Wednesday holidays in August, something less obvious?), but it could just be an arbitrary anomaly.
4. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)- Males are high users during the peak hours

5. Trips by Gender and User Type (Weekday per Hour)- Male subscribers are the highest users followed by female subscribers

6. Number of Rides per Hour- Nonpeak hours are 1-5 am

7. Number of Rides with Bike IK- the divergence line shows that there are high use on 1/3 of the bikes

## Summary
-Nonpeak hours are 1-5am. These hours would be the best times to conduct bike repairs and redistribution of bikes from full stations to less-full stations. 
- Male subscribers are the highest users and follow the traditional high use times of travel to and from work.
- The target audience are males who need transportation to work (rushhour in the morning and evening) and for weekend activities. It would be a good idea to recommend a subscription service
## Additional Research
1. Ride Starting locations by Gender- Male users typically start a trip across the river in the southwest part of NYC compared to female users

2. Ride Ending Locations by Gender- Male users typically end a trip across the river in the southwest part of NYC compared to female users

3. User Type Starting Location- subscribers usually start their trip on the out skirt of NYC than other places.
